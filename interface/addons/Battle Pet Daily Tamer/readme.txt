Battle Pet Daily Tamer puts a familiar paw on the world map to mark where daily pet tamers are that you have not completed for the day.

From the tracking menu on the world map you can choose to selectively disable/enable:
- Pet Reward Dailies (green paw): These are dailies that reward a pet supply satchel, pet charm or token to buy pet supplies.
- Normal Dailies (blue paw): These are dailies that reward xp but no extra rewards.
- Beasts of Fables (orange paw): These are the legendary pets to battle, if you have picked up the Book of Fables quests.
- On Flight Maps Too (flying boot): This setting will show paws on the flight map, so you can choose where to fly closest to a daily. It is off by default.
- Stable Masters (horseshoe): This setting will display a horseshoe on the zone map where stable masters are located. It is off by default.

Also:
- If you use the addon TomTom, ctrl+right click of a paw will set a waypoint to that paw.
- If you have an addon that prevents accessing the above options from the world map's tracking menu (such as PetTracker), you can set them in the Interface Options Panel: Escape to Game Menu -> Interface -> Addons -> Battle Pet Daily Tamer.
- Mousing over a paw on the map will show the level of the tamer's pets and their types.
- Left-click of a paw will zoom into the zone where the tamer is located.
- Right-click of a paw will zoom out.
