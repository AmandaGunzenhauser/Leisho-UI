--------------------

Benjamin Staneck:
	- silence a global
Infus:
	- Make gigantic dynamic groups editable in the options
	Add a PauseAllDynamicGroups() and ResumeAllDynamicGroups() which
	temporarily delays all ControlChildren calls.
	
	The dynamic groups are paused before mass editing, such as importing,
	clicking the view icon, deleting the group. This makes it significantly
	faster to edit those auars.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 581
Benjamin Staneck:
	- OCD formatting
	- fix a typo
Infus:
	- Fix Equiment Set Trigger toggle -> "toggle"
	- Fix Action useable interaction with gcd change
	A duration of 0 means that the spell is not on cooldown. All other places
	already check for duration > 0.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 580
	- Linked a "deleted" WeakAura shows a error
	Steps to reproduce:
	1. Link a aura
	2. Delete it
	3. Click on link
	
	Apply fix suggested by MaXiMiUS.
	- Fix icons for spells that only other specs have
	A recent change made Cooldown Progress use the spellName instead of
	the spellId to fetch information. This works better because, for
	some classes the "same" spell has different spellIds depending on
	spec.
	
	But if a spec doesn't have that spell, using the spellName returns
	no information. So fall back to the spell id in that case.
	- Fix another animation problem with states
	Ticket-Nr: 572
Benjamin Staneck:
	- Add Templates to the locale miner and run it
Infus:
	- Add Shaman Totem triggers, change Rune of Power to use Totem trigger
	- Adjust to Survival Hunter talent reshuffling
	- Adjust to review comments part 1
	- Add Templates to WeakAuras
	This adds a new button "From Template" to the New display, which can be
	used to create auras from a list of display templates and trigger
	templates.
	- Use a check against the actual gcd instead of > 1.51
	Also don't check for startTime as that might contain a value even
	if the spell isn't really on cd. Instead check for duration.
	- Fix aura_env.state being empty on first run of custom code
	Also set it if we are creating the aura_env.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 577
	- Fix Ascendance + Lava Burst Cooldown trigger
	If Lava Burst is on cooldown and Ascendance is triggered, which
	resets the cooldown of LavaBurst the following information is returned
	by GetSpellCharges:
	StartTime: the old expiration time
	Charges: 0, MaxCharges: 2
	Duration: 0
	
	So apparently a duration 0 spell has to be treated as if it's not
	on cooldown.
	
	Override charges to return 1 in that case. As the Spell Cooldown
	trigger has a condition on Charges and I think it's saner if
	checking for charges >= 1 shows the aura even if charges is
	apparently 0 in that case.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 571
	- Fix Error with state for custom animation
	Again, while the options are open region's don't have a valid state.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 572
	- Be consistent what a nil sound_channel means
	Ticket-Nr: 567
	- Fix GenericTrigger.GetNameAndIcon for custom triggers
	Make it check that the type is "event" or "status" similar to
	every other function.
	- Fix GenericTrigger.GetNameAndIcon for custom triggers
	Make it check that the type is "event" or "status" similar to
	every other function.
	- Rewrite Totem trigger for Legion
	Previously each totem slot could have a totem of a specific type.
	Now totems have no types anymore and simply take the lowest free slot.
	And e.g. Elemental Shamans can put multiple earthquake totems at
	the same time.
	
	The new totem trigger now can:
	- Display the totem in a specific slot
	- Or check all slots for a specifc totem name
	  - And display all matching totems
	- Or display all totems
	
	There's a hardcoded limit of 5 totems in the Blizzard api and no
	way to even get that constant. So put a limit of 5 into the code.
	- Fix combat log trigger not showing the right duration
	The state for generic triggers is updated in two steps. 1) By the trigger
	function and 2) by ActivateEvent which adds all the other dynamic
	information. If a trigger function is a "all" trigger function,
	that is it supports cloning it needs to indicate on which states
	ActivateEvent must be called on. Do that by setting changed to true
	in those cases.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 564
Benjamin Staneck:
	- prettify the tooltip, sort it the same way as the EJ does and display instance name headers
	Thanks for the help with the EJ API, neb <3
	- remove the need to translate boss names
Infus:
	- Aurabar: Switch progress of no duration triggers
	Makes the aurabar more useful for triggers with "Always Show".
	
	Ticket-Nr: 523
	- Make Cooldown Progress work better with spells that have multiple spellIds
	For example Ascendance has 3 different spell ids depending on the spec:
	114050 Elemental
	114051 Enhancement
	114052 Restoration
	
	Using any of those ids will now correctly show the progress information
	from any of them.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 148
Benjamin Staneck:
	- remove old comments
	- fix a leaked global and remove some old comments
Infus:
	- Fix Modernize for Combo Points
	- Fix icon cooldowns having the wrong frame level
	If multiple icons are in a group, their frame level are adjusted so
	that they each get a unique frame level.
	
	For icons we need to also adjust the frame levels of the cooldown
	and stacks frame.
	
	See https://youtu.be/51l5gqQIi7k for what it looks like before and
	after.
	
	This seems to be new in Legion.
	- Fix rotation of texts on aurabar and circular progress
	Animations with 0 duration no longer work, and something is
	very strange with Scrollframes. Moving them around seems to not
	properly clip.
	- Make the linter happier at least in a few files
	- Fix Custom actions ending in a -- comment not working
	Since that comments out a "end". Fix that by adding a newline.
	- Add a stacks function to DK rune triggers
	All the other power triggers have a stack function. For DKs make
	it return the avaible runes.
	- Fix nil error in pendingTracks
	I can't recall what exactly I did, but it must have been something like.
	a) Use a multi buff trigger to add a guid to the pending tracks,
	   that is don't target it.
	b) Delete it
	c) Target the unit, which calls uidTrack, calling updateSpell
	- Fix name display of Multi buff trigger
	- Fix specific unit text field not appearing
	The bug shows up on changing a aura trigger to "specific unit" and then
	changing and then switching to Status/Health. The unit combobox shows
	specific unit, but the specific unit text field is missing.
	
	The cause for that is, that the specific unit text field for the
	Status/Health trigger is created in WeakAurasOptions.lua around line 900
	and checks for trigger.use_specific_unit. The set function of the
	Status/Health/Unit combobox sets trigger.use_specific_unit.
	
	The specific unit combo box for the Aura trigger is created around line
	4570, and this one just sets trigger.unit but does not set
	trigger.use_specific_unit.
	
	Fix that by making the aura trigger also set trigger.use_specific_unit.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 559
	- Fix DK rune count trigger
	Ticket-Nr: 560
	- Fix typo in GenericTrigger.lua
	- BuffTrigger: SpellId triggers should match all auras with the same name
	That is for non fullscan auras and given a spellId, the buff trigger
	should only match the name of the spellId.
	
	This makes some use cases easier, e.g. a cross-language trigger for
	a boss ability that has multiple different spell ids.
	
	On the other hand matching on the spellId in addition adds no benefit.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 554
	- Fix text position if the text is empty on loading
	Ticket-Nr: 556
	- Remove various power type triggers in favour of the Power trigger
	Also add Stagger to the Power trigger
	- Multi Buff trigger: Use NAME_PLATE_UNIT_ADDED/REMOVED
	Track the guids of nameplates, making the multi trigger being able
	to determine progress information for units with nameplates.
	
	Also add handling for focus.
Benjamin Staneck:
	- used GUID for source in the combat log triggers, too
Infus:
	- Make spec selector return the class specs even if on a diffrent class
	Also fix that the load condions behaved strangely on multi selection
	- Fix mismerge
	- Fix SPELL_AURA_APPLIED_DOSE resetting the icon and progress information.
	This readds code, that I accidentaly removed in the trigger state
	commit.
	- Combat Log Trigger: Add sourceGUID to aura_env.state
	Probably useful for someone and trivial to do. destGUID is alredy there
	- Fix combat log trigger condition for sourceUnit
	Need to rename source to sourceName also in the sourceUnit's test.
	- Fix typo preventing group auras from hiding
	- Fix bug with trigger states
	- Also change the tooltips from #word# to %word
Benjamin Staneck:
	- add alternate mana as a trigger for classes that use it (druid, shaman, priest)
Infus:
	- In modernize for combat log trigger, check that trigger is not nil
	- Change #word# to %word
	Rename a few combat log variables.
Benjamin Staneck:
	- forgot a slash
	- forgot a slash
Infus:
	- Add a new custom trigger function that directly modifies trigger states
	This allows for custom triggers to create clones. Documentation is
	at http://www.wowace.com/addons/weakauras-2/pages/custom-triggers/
	- BigWigs: Add clone support to both messages and timers
	Also BigWigs messages now have a proper icon and store the message
	- DBM: Add cloning support to both timer and announce
	Also add the right icon for the announce trigger and make %n return
	the message.
	- Add clone support to the chat message trigger
	- GenericTrigger: Improve combat log trigger
	By adding additional text replacements for pretty much every parameter.
	Also add clone support to it.
	
	Also add "level" and "class" text replacements to the unit characteristics
	trigger.
	- Add additional text replacements for BuffTriggers
	Add #spellId# and #unitCaster# that show the caster.
	- Add Trigger States to store information
	Those store all information of the triggers, e.g. duration, icons.
	This allows for e.g. showing the information of the second trigger if the
	first trigger is not active.
	
	This is the basis of more to come.
	
	Also first evaluate all triggers before applying change, fixing:
	Ticket-Nr: 501
Benjamin Staneck:
	- Use our new logo in game, too.
	- Use our new logo in game, too.
Infus:
	- Add Timewalking dungeon difficulty
	- Correct load condition for Undead
Benjamin Staneck:
	- Happiness => Combo Points
maximumpanda:
	- Add Insantity to Power_Types.
Infus:
	- Make pasting huge import strings lightning fast
	Use code provided by Semlar to make pasting a lot faster.
	The edit box no longer shows the full contents of the pasted text,
	but that's not a huge loss.
	- Fix editing multiple auras with multiple triggers
	Testcase that shows the problems:
	Import http://pastebin.com/rS4S5ePq, that is a group with two auras.
	Both auras contain 3 identical triggers.
	
	Bug 1:
	Select the group, switch to the trigger tab. Notice that only
	two triggers are listed in the choose trigger combo box.
	
	Bug 2:
	Choose both auras (not the group), switch to the trigger tab,
	in the choose trigger combo select the second or third trigger
	- Tweak spell scanning so that it finds more spells
	Reported by nevcairiel on irc
	- Fix another two image functions
	- Ups didn't rename callers
Benjamin Staneck:
	- Local a Blizz API
Infus:
	- AceConfig image functions should return a string
	So make them return a string instead of a fileId
	- Rework icon cache for Legion
	The icon "paths" are now fileIds in legion. Also while working in that
	area, make the iconCache key the name and spellId, thus fixing that
	duplicated spell name would overwrite the icon for each other.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 526
	Ticket-Nr: 228
	- Replace SetTexture(r, g, b, a) with SetColorTexture
	- Update ModelPaths list for current 7.0 state
	List provided on reddit by Bladeleaf
	- Update talents load conditions for Legion
	Add PvP Talents
	And make talent_cache spec specific, there's little overlap between specs
	nowadays.
	
	Also fallback to the current class/spec if no class/spec load condition
	is set. Feels a bit nicer.
	- Fix Rune trigger for Legion
Benjamin Staneck:
	- add translation scraper by nebula
	- move from UNIT_POWER to UNIT_POWER_FREQUENT to track ressources
	- remove the timer region type; it has been replaced by texts ages ago.
	- remove the fontSize > 35 hack, the new font engine in 7.0 can render text at any size perfectly fine
	- remove UNIT_COMBO_POINTS, it is gone
	- bump the TOC to 70000
	- add Fury and Pain power types
	- add Arcane Charges power type
	- add Maelstrom power type
	- add Astral Power; no idea why the global is called Lunar Power, but it is.
	- remove demonic fury and burning embers
	- Shadow Orbs => Insanity
	- remove eclipse support
	- remove glyph support
